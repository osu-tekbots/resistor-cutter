This directory contains the Arduino libraries necessary to compile the ResistorCutter script.
It has been backed up here to ensure the correct versions survive.

**NOTE:** Some libraries have been modified to add additional functionality for the ResistorCutter script. 
**None of these changes inhibit the use of these libraries in other sketches.**
While these changes are most easily made by simply using the files here, they have also been well-documented in the ResistorCutter scripts where the changes are necessary.
As such, the changes can also be made to an existing copy of the libraries if needbe.
